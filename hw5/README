COMP 131: Artificial Intelligence

I have successfully implented an Artificial Neural Network from scratch with
fairly good accuracy. My ANN can usually predict the correct plant class
80-95% of the time (the accuracy occasionally drops below that range).

I initialized my weights as random values from (-1, 1), and scale my inputs to
fit the range (-6, 6), as discussed in class. I closely followed the equations
given in the slides, and have included all necessary components of an ANN. My
network has 1 hidden layer.

To run my program on Fisher's database, simply enter "python hw5.py" with the
file "ANN - Iris data.txt" in the same directory.

Note: I used the sklearn library to help me scale my input values using the
MinMaxScaler method. I did not use any methods in this library that implements
learning in the algorithm for me. I spoke to the TA, Junyi He, and he said this
was OK because I am only using this module for calculations.

Note: I definitely thought this was the most difficult assignment of the year,
and I spent far longer on it than any other. Especially with the lack of in
person office hours, this one was very hard to figure out conceptually.
