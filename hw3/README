We implemented our sudoku solver using a backtracking approach to Constraint
Satisfaction Problems. Our algorithm works as follows:
    1. Find an open spot
    2. Find a valid number to put in that spot
         a. If no valid number (1-9) is found, backtrack to the last entry and
            try the next valid number
    3. Repeat steps 1-2 (recursively) until the entire board is solved

We included our tests for the program in main(), which solved the sample
sudoku puzzles that were provided for us.
